# TripSharing

The TripSharing project is a Web application designed to manage trip-related data, including user profiles, trip details, and trip history. It utilizes a RESTful API approach to handle client-server communication, ensuring flexibility and scalability. The project architecture is organized into key components such as controllers, services, repositories, and entities, following best practices for modularity and maintainability.
The project integrates React.js as the frontend framework to provide a seamless user experience. This combination of Spring Boot on the backend and React.js on the frontend enables efficient development, deployment, and management of trip management and expense automation functionalities.
